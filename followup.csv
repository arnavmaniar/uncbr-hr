Table Rock Family Medicine,5, 
UNCBR Behavioral Health,5,"None, it’s been wonderful. "
Patient Care Coordinator ,5,nothing to date
Float Pool,5,The check-off lists could be updated- they're a bit redundant and if you're trained in multiple areas of the hospital many of the items for sign off are duplicated. They also include many interventions that aren't even performed at this facility.   
Security,5,The presentation as a whole was perfect.
Case Management,5,N/A
Hickory Pain Management ,5,nothing 
Womens Health Group,5,N/A

Maintenance Grace Ridge,5,Having to do online training that is not relevant to my job.
Float Pool ,2,"During hospital orientation the presentation regarding benefits was the most rushed through thing compared to all the other speakers and presentations that we sat through that day. I consider that to be one of the most important things as a full time employee and I didn't not take anything away from the presentation. I would suggest slowing down and actually going through the benefit options so that the new staff can be fully informed and prepared to make the best and most beneficial decision when enrolling in benefits. Also, no one showed me where to find or how to view my pay stub. "
Valdese Medical Associates ,5,Session online or in person regarding coding and billing if provider is new to primary care. 
Morganton Internal Medicine,4,
Surgical Services,5, 
Rehabilitation Services,5,I think Adding a Day or two to the Week of Orientation would help you be able to Watch the Modules that are assigned to you to watch by a certain date. I had 26 modules to watch. Once you get to be on your job it is a lot of training and no time to watch the modules. Even if you add just one day to help with that would be very beneficial.
Behavioral Health,5,Nne
Float pool,4,No suggestion 
ICU,5,Allow time during orientation to sign up for benefits 
Cancer Center Valdese,5,"More hands on training for PICC, IV and Port Access"
